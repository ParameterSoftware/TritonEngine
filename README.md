The Spartan Engine
=============

##Description

The main goal of this project is to create a game engine that is open source, both advanced and easy to use and free. This engine will evolve to be faster and better with each developing day. Hopefully we can request your help.

##List To Do

- Graphics(VBO, Graphic Entities, Image/Model Objects and File Loaders, ect.)
- Audio(Audio Objects and File Loaders)
- Networking
- Math
- Utilities
- Window Management

##Contrbution Guidelines

You are asked to use camelCase for variables in type declarations

If you are adding a independent function, please do this in front of it "se(changes depending on its location)" e.g: seu for utilities or seg for graphics

Similar rules apply to new classes but they follow capital letters like SEG for graphics or SEA for audio

Use the tabs indent mode and 8 indent size

##Warning

This is not complete, do not expect to work yet. When version 0.1.0 is said finished in the issues then it will be ready for basic use. Expect things like tests and examples. Do not expect optimization until at least version 0.3.0.

##Planned Projects
