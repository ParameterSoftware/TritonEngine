The Spartan Engine
=============

##Description

The main goal of this project is to create a game engine that is open source, both complex and easy to use, mostly independent, and free. The engine itself will have top notch graphics and audio, great networking (with a new experimental networking system that I will not release much more details on just yet) and plenty of other features that a normal game engine will have. This engine will allow easy interaction for anyone with minimal programing experience to people who want to control every tiny detail of the entire engine in their game. This engine will evolve to be faster and better with each developing day. Hopefully we can request your help.

##Contrbution Guidelines

You are asked to use camelCase for variables in class or other non-primative type declarations

If you are adding a independent function, please do this in front of it "se(changes depending on its location)" e.g: seu for utilities or seg for graphics

Similar rules apply to new classes but they follow capital letters like SEG for graphics or SEA for audio

On any C or C++ file use the tabs indent mode and 8 indent size

##Warning

This is not complete, do not expect to work yet. When version 0.1.0 is said finished in the issues then it will be ready for basic use. (Expect things like tests and examples)
